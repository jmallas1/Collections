# Collections

The following In-Class Activity was completed and is visible in GitHub in a repository called Collections.

For full credit, the project must include JavaDoc comments and JUnit tests for non-void methods.

* Download “Collection Work” from Blackboard and open in IntelliJ.
* List the top 100 most used words and how many times they were used. (Once you do 10, 100 will be easy.)
* List the number of words that are only used once.
